### INSTRUCTIONS

> The easiest way : download .zip file from the repository to desired location, once directed to current location via terminal on your machine (_in layman's terms â€“ computer, laptop_) e.g. `cd ./current-location` run the following on the terminal : A) `npm i` (package.json) OR B) `npm ci` (package-lock.json) it's up to you ; 

NOTE : before running command either A or B selectively, I assume you already extracted downloaded .zip in the e.g. aforementioned `./current-location`
